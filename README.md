# Project: The Retro Garage

At The Retro Garage, we celebrate the essence of classic cars, where each vehicle tells a unique story of design, engineering, and passion. From legendary models of the 1950s to timeless gems from the golden decades of automotive history, our website is a haven for car enthusiasts. Here, you will find a carefully curated selection of articles, anecdotes, and photographs that pay tribute to automotive heritage. Our goal is to preserve the legacy of these cars, reviving the excitement they evoke and fostering a community of enthusiasts who appreciate not only the aesthetics of these vehicles but also the art and history they represent. Join us on this journey through time, where every car is a piece of history waiting to be discovered. Welcome to The Retro Garage, where the engine never stops!



## Acknowledgments
First and foremost, we extend our thanks to Tiburcio for their ongoing explanations, assistance, and advice. Their patience and dedication helped us overcome various obstacles throughout the process. Thanks to their knowledge and experience, we made advancements and improvements to our project in ways we hadn't imagined.

We also want to thank Learn Web for their tutorial on how to overlay text on images. Their clear and detailed guidance was invaluable in making our images more appealing and communicative. Without their support, we wouldn't have been able to achieve the design level we aimed for.
